# Auto_HR_analysis
Solved high employee turnover at Salifort Motors by building an Early Warning System. Using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), I developed Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict churn. Identified burnout (high hours/projects) as a key driver, providing HR with data-driven retention strategies to reduce hiring costs.
