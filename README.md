# Auto_HR_analysis
Solved employee retention at Salifort Motors by building predictive models to identify churn. Using Python, I developed Random Forest and Logistic Regression models that pinpointed burnout, tenure, and workload as key drivers. Provided HR with actionable policies to cap projects and reward overtime to save costs.

Python Skills Demonstrated

Data Analysis & Visualization: Utilized libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to generate feature importance bar plots, identifying that last_evaluation, number_project, and tenure were the most relevant variables.

Feature Engineering: Created or utilized specific features such as overworked to capture complex employee sentiments.

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn):

Logistic Regression: Evaluated as a potential categorical predictor.

Decision Trees: Built models to interpret specific splits in employee behavior.

Random Forest: Implemented an ensemble method that outperformed the decision tree, providing superior predictive power for the target variable left.


Impactful Business Results

High-Fidelity Predictions: The Random Forest model accurately predicts whether an employee will leave, allowing for proactive rather than reactive HR interventions.

Strategic Resource Allocation: Identified that capping project numbers can directly mitigate turnover risk.

Cultural & Financial Optimization: * Recommended restructuring rewards for high-evaluation employees to decouple "success" from extreme 200+ hour work months.

Proposed specific interventions for 4-year tenured employees to protect the company's investment in experienced talent.

Advised on clarifying overtime and workload expectations to improve overall company work culture.
